### $$ = the auther

The auther of this site is [me](https://github.com/by-cloud). An undergraduate student in Computer Science and Mathematics. Studied in China Mainland and United States. Focus on scripting, coding, research and games.

My [story](https://stackoverflow.com/story/by-cloud) and my [CV](https://stackoverflow.com/cv/by-cloud).

### $0 = this site

This site is watching my studying process. Using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to build personal blog is now a good fit for me. My blog should become a library for me, in the future I need some relevant references anywhere, call the post in it.

### $x = posts

Posts are pre-defined references I can invoke anywhere in the future.
I organize posts when reading a book, taking a course, reviewing notes and wrangling my thoughts.
Post [Issues](https://github.com/by-cloud/myblog/issues) if you have any issues. Feel free to [e-mail me](mailto:claude.by.cloud@gmail.com).
