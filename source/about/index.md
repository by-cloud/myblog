### $0 = this site

This site is watching my studying process. Using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to build personal blog is now a good fit for me. My blog should become a library for me, in the future I need some relevant references anywhere, call the post in it.

### $x = posts

Posts are pre-defined references I can invoke anywhere in the future.
I organize posts when reading a book, taking a course, reviewing notes and wrangling my thoughts.
Post [Issues](https://github.com/by-cloud/myblog/issues) if you have any issue. Feel free to [e-mail me](mailto:claude.by.cloud@gmail.com).
