The community is like a market.

Keep readers in mind.

Use toy examples to convey your idea.

Experiment should be sufficient(apply to meaningful problem and compare to other solutions).

End with conclusion/summary, future work is the weakest end, don’t use it.

Be concise.

Paper should work in every hierarchies:

- Title
- Title + abstract
- Title + abs/intro + figs
- Full text

The figure captions should be self-contained and the caption should tell the reader what to notice about the figure.

Your complex formulas will be replaced by “blablabla”, the rest of fluent English should still make sense.

Tone: be kind and gracious.

Develop a reputation for being clear and reliable(and for doing creative, good work…).

Be honest.

Spend time to think a good title.

Quick and easy reasons to reject a paper:
    Do the authors not deliver what they promise?
    Are important references missing? (and therefore one suspects the authors not up on the state-of-the-art for this problem?)
    Are the results too incremental(too similar to previous work)
    Are the results believable?
    Is the paper poorly written?
    Are there mistakes or incorrect statements?

Good writing is re-writing, it often helps to put the paper down and return to it fresh later. This means you need to start writing the paper early!
