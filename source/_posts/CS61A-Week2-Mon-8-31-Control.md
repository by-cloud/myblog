Review: A side effect is not a value, it is a **behavior**, it's anything that happens as a consequence of calling a function.

### Print and None

None indicates that nothing is returned. The special value None represents nothing in Python.

A function that does not explicitly return a value will return None.

`None` is not be displayed by Python interpreter as the value of an expression.

```Python
>>> 'Go Bears!'
'Go Bears!'
>>> print('Go Bears!')
Go Bears!

>>> None
>>> print(None)
None
```
